# SAM Software Automatic Mouth

## What is SAM?

This is a C# port of the Text-To-Speech (TTS) software
SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore C64 published in the
year 1982 by Don't Ask Software (now SoftVoice, Inc.).

It is based on the adaption to C by
[Stefan Macke](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM)
and the refactorings by 
[Vidar Hokstad](https://github.com/vidarh/SAM) and
[8BitPimp](https://github.com/8BitPimp/SAM), further rewritten in JavaScript by [discordier](https://github.com/discordier/sam).

It includes a Text-To-Phoneme converter called reciter and a
Phoneme-To-Speech routine for the final output.

Some analytics of S.A.M. in general can be found in Artyom Skrobov's
(@tyomitch) blog who also provided pretty insightful PRs.

## Usage

### Example code usage

Typical example:

```cs
Sam sam = new Sam();
byte[] audio = sam.Speak("Hello, my name is SAM.");
// Do something with the audio, for example play it or save to a file
```

With custom options:

```cs
Sam sam = new Sam(new Options(speed: 82, pitch: 72, throat: 110, mouth: 105));
byte[] audio = sam.Speak("Hello, my name is Stuffy Guy.");
```

Phonetic mode:

```cs
Sam sam = new Sam();
byte[] audio = sam.SpeakPhonetic("DHIHS IHZ FAHNEHTIHK MOW5D");
```

Async synthesis is also possible:

```cs
Sam sam = new Sam();
sam.SpeakAsync("I am speaking asynchronously").ContinueWith(audio => DoSomething(audio));
```

### Command line usage

The `SamSharpTest` project contains a simple testing program, which can be run from the command line to try out SAM. Run it with:

```
./SamSharpTest [-p --pitch pitch] [-s --speed speed] [-m --mouth mouth] [-t --throat throat] [--phonetic] [--sing] [-o --output path/to/file.wav] <text to speak> 
```

If the `-o` option is omitted, the program will play the synthesized speech on your default audio device. The `pitch`, `speed`, `mouth` and `throat` parameters should be numbers from 0 to 255.

## Original docs

I have bundled a copy of the original manual in this repository, see
the [manual](docs/manual.md) file in the [docs](docs) directory.

## License

The software is a reverse-engineered version of a commercial software
published more than 30 years ago. The current copyright holder is 
SoftVoice, Inc. (www.text2speech.com)

Any attempt to contact the company failed. The website was last
updated in the year 2009. The status of the original
software can therefore best described as abandonware
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware)

As long this is the case I cannot put my code under any specific open
source software license. Use it at your own risk.

## Contact

If you have questions don't hesitate to ask me. If you discovered some
new knowledge about the code please file an issue.
